## Key Benefits

### For Designer Agents
1. **Better Delegation**: Understand executor constraints when writing instructions
2. **Improved Monitoring**: Know what UI tools are available
3. **Clearer Workflows**: Step-by-step review and merge procedures
4. **MCP Mastery**: Comprehensive documentation of available tools

### For Executor Agents
1. **Environment Awareness**: Understand Docker isolation and access boundaries
2. **Faster Debugging**: Troubleshooting guide for common issues
3. **Better Testing**: Clear pre-completion checklist
4. **Git Confidence**: Understand worktree operations and best practices
5. **Reduced Confusion**: Know exactly what they can/cannot access

### For System Reliability
1. **Fewer Errors**: Agents understand limitations and report issues correctly
2. **Better Communication**: Clear guidelines for parent-child interaction
3. **Improved Quality**: Testing guidance ensures work is verified
4. **Faster Recovery**: Troubleshooting section helps agents self-diagnose

## Rationale for Major Changes

### Why Add Docker/Container Information?
**Problem**: Executors were confused about file access limitations and why certain paths weren't accessible.

**Solution**: Explicit documentation of Docker isolation model, mounted volumes, and container-vs-host paths.

**Impact**: Executors understand their environment boundaries and report access issues with proper context.

### Why Add Git Worktree Details?
**Problem**: Agents didn't understand the branching model or why their changes weren't visible to parent immediately.

**Solution**: Clear explanation of worktree architecture, branch naming, and isolation benefits.

**Impact**: Agents understand their place in the workflow and follow git best practices.

### Why Add Testing Section?
**Problem**: Executors reported completion without verifying their work, leading to merge failures.

**Solution**: Comprehensive testing checklist with concrete examples.

**Impact**: Higher quality work delivered to parent, fewer review cycles.

### Why Add Troubleshooting Guide?
**Problem**: Executors got stuck on common issues and either guessed solutions or reported with insufficient context.

**Solution**: Common issues catalog with specific remediation steps and reporting guidance.

**Impact**: Faster problem resolution, better error reports to parent.

### Why Document MCP Tools Thoroughly?
**Problem**: Agents used tools with incorrect parameters or didn't understand what tools do.

**Solution**: Full parameter documentation, examples, and workflow explanations.

**Impact**: Correct tool usage, fewer MCP errors, better parent-child communication.

## Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Static Validation
- ✅ Verify prompt syntax is valid Python
- ✅ Check template variables are properly formatted
- ✅ Ensure no broken markdown formatting

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. **Spawn Test Executor**: Have designer spawn executor with test task
2. **Verify Prompt Rendering**: Check executor sees new sections
3. **Test MCP Tools**: Verify spawn_subagent and send_message_to_session work
4. **Check File Access**: Confirm executor can access /workspace

### Phase 3: Real-World Validation
1. **Simple Task**: Assign straightforward implementation task
2. **Complex Task**: Assign multi-step task requiring parent communication
3. **Error Scenario**: Give task with missing dependency to test error reporting
4. **Review Workflow**: Test executor completion and designer review/merge

## Files Created

1. **`prompt_analysis.md`** (1,700 lines)
   - Comprehensive gap analysis
   - Implementation strategy
   - Success criteria

2. **`PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Executive summary
   - Change details
   - Rationale and benefits

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Review changes with parent
2. ✅ Test prompt rendering in actual sessions
3. ✅ Validate MCP tool usage

### Short-term
1. Monitor executor behavior with new prompts
2. Gather feedback on clarity and completeness
3. Iterate based on real-world usage

### Long-term
1. Consider extracting shared technical reference to separate file
2. Add more examples based on common patterns
3. Create troubleshooting database from actual issues
4. Document pairing mode once implemented

## Metrics for Success

**Qualitative Indicators:**
- Executors ask fewer "where is X?" questions
- Better quality error reports with full context
- Fewer unnecessary parent interruptions
- Higher quality work delivered on first iteration

**Quantitative Indicators:**
- Reduced average time from spawn to completion
- Fewer task failures due to environment confusion
- Higher test pass rate in executor worktrees
- Reduced merge conflicts and issues

## Conclusion

The enhanced prompts provide agents with comprehensive understanding of their technical environment, available tools, and operational workflows. Changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving agent effectiveness. The prompts now serve as both instructions and reference documentation, reducing confusion and improving task completion quality.

Key achievement: Transformed prompts from high-level role descriptions into detailed operational manuals that agents can reference throughout their work.
