# Project Architecture & Knowledge

This file serves as the entry point for all project documentation maintained by Orchestra agents. It references other documents and captures architectural decisions, patterns, and knowledge discovered during development.

## Purpose

This documentation system helps agents:
- Understand existing patterns and decisions before starting new tasks
- Avoid repeating past mistakes or duplicating work
- Maintain consistency across different sessions and implementations
- Build on knowledge discovered by previous agents

## How to Use This System

### For All Agents
- **Read First**: Check this file and any relevant linked documents before starting a new task
- **Update After**: When you complete significant work, update docs to capture key insights
- **Link Liberally**: Reference other files using markdown links `[description](./path/to/file.md)`
- **Keep It Lightweight**: Focus on valuable insights, not exhaustive logs

### What to Document
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Patterns discovered or established in the codebase
- Important gotchas or non-obvious behaviors
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Testing strategies and requirements
