# Viewing Orchestra Logs with Full Conversation Transcripts

## 1. Collect logs (run this on EC2):
uv run cerb-collect-logs

## 2. View logs via web interface:

# On your LOCAL machine, set up SSH port forwarding:
ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 fulcrum

# Then open this URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8501

## What You'll See:

The viewer now includes a "Conversation History" category with FULL JSONL transcripts:
- Complete user prompts AND assistant responses
- Tool calls and their results
- Timestamps and model info
- Token usage statistics
- Searchable conversation content

Much more detailed than just debug logs!
